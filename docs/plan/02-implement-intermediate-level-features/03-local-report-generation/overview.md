# Phase 03: Local Report Generation

## Goal
Enable users to generate structured local reports from the data collected during browser sessions or AI interactions. This allows for persistent documentation of findings beyond the CLI output.

## Objectives
- Implement a basic reporting system using templates.
- Support common formats (e.g., Markdown, HTML).
- Allow users to specify output files for reports.

## Tasks
1. **01-implement-basic-report-template**: Create a base template for reports and the logic to populate it.
2. **02-implement-markdown-report-export**: Add a command or flag to export findings as a Markdown file.
3. **03-implement-html-report-export**: (Optional/Future) Add support for HTML reports with basic styling.
4. **04-integrate-report-generation-with-summarize**: Allow `aria page summarize` to directly save to a report file.
