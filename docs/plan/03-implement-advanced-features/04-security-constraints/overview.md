# Phase 04: Security and Constraints

## Goal
Establish security best practices and usage constraints for Aria to ensure safe operation, especially when handling sensitive data or performing automated web interactions.

## Objectives
- Implement security hygiene reminders and best practices documentation.
- Define constraints for automated interactions (e.g., rate limiting, sensitive site warnings).
- Ensure secrets (like API keys) are handled securely.

## Tasks
1. **01-security-hygiene-documentation**: Document security best practices for using Aria.
2. **02-implement-sensitive-site-warnings**: Identify and warn users when navigating to potentially sensitive sites (e.g., banking, login pages).
3. **03-rate-limiting-and-throttling**: Implement basic rate limiting for automated browser operations to avoid being flagged as malicious.
