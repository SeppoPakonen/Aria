# Phase 05: Extensibility Architecture Design

## Goal
Design a preliminary architecture for extending Aria's capabilities through a plugin or module system, allowing users to add custom commands, navigators, or AI providers.

## Objectives
- Define the core interfaces for plugins.
- Design a mechanism for discovering and loading external modules.
- Create a proof-of-concept for a simple "Hello World" plugin.

## Tasks
1. **01-define-plugin-interfaces**: Document the proposed interfaces for custom commands and tool integrations.
2. **02-design-plugin-loader**: Plan the mechanism for dynamic loading of Python modules as Aria extensions.
3. **03-poc-plugin-implementation**: Implement a very basic "internal" plugin as a demonstration of the architecture.
