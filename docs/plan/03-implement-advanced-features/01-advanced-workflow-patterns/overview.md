# Phase 01: Advanced Workflow Patterns

## Goal
Design and implement patterns for complex, multi-step web interactions that involve multiple tabs and data synthesis across different sites.

## Objectives
- Define strategies for comparing content across multiple open tabs.
- Implement cross-site data synthesis using AI prompts.
- Document common patterns for multi-tab "recipes".

## Tasks
1. **01-design-multi-tab-comparison-patterns**: Research and document patterns for comparing information (e.g., pricing, features) across multiple tabs.
2. **02-implement-cross-tab-synthesis-helpers**: Enhance the CLI or `navigator` to better support gathering context from multiple specified tabs.
3. **03-create-advanced-recipes**: Add complex multi-tab recipes to `docs/runbooks/50-recipes.md`.
