# Phase 03: Deep Diagnostics and Monitoring

## Goal
Enhance the observability of Aria by providing detailed, structured, and actionable diagnostic information.

## Objectives
- Implement structured logging to facilitate automated log analysis.
- Integrate performance telemetry to identify bottlenecks.
- Introduce trace IDs for cross-module operation tracking.

## Tasks
1. **01-enhance-logging-structured-data**: Shift from plain text to semi-structured or structured logging (JSON-like) for better parsing.
2. **02-implement-performance-telemetry**: Track and log execution times for major browser operations.
3. **03-trace-id-integration**: Introduce unique trace IDs for requests to track operations through various layers.
