   (e.g., `C:\WebDriver\bin`, then add `C:\WebDriver\bin` to Path Environment Variable).

## Verification
To verify installation, try running a simple Selenium script:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service as ChromeService
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service as FirefoxService

try:
    # Try Chrome
    print("Trying Chrome...")
    service = ChromeService(executable_path="chromedriver") # Assumes chromedriver is in PATH
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=service)
    driver.get("http://www.google.com")
    print(f"Chrome Title: {driver.title}")
    driver.quit()
    print("Chrome test successful.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Chrome test failed: {e}")

try:
    # Try Firefox
    print("Trying Firefox...")
    service = FirefoxService(executable_path="geckodriver") # Assumes geckodriver is in PATH
    driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=service)
    driver.get("http://www.google.com")
    print(f"Firefox Title: {driver.title}")
    driver.quit()
    print("Firefox test successful.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Firefox test failed: {e}")
```
Save this as `test_driver.py` and run `python test_driver.py`.
