# Phase 06: CLI Safety and User Feedback

## Goal
Implement mechanisms to ensure user safety and provide clear feedback during CLI operations. This includes warnings, disclaimers, and confirmations for potentially destructive or impactful actions.

## Tasks
1. **01-implement-safety-warnings-and-disclaimers**: Show a disclaimer on first run or when performing certain actions.
2. **02-enhance-command-feedback**: Ensure all commands provide clear success or error messages.
3. **03-implement-interactive-confirmations**: Add generic confirmation prompts for sensitive operations (beyond just `script remove`).
