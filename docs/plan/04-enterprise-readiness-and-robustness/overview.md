# Track 04: Enterprise Readiness and Robustness

## Goal
Transform Aria from a powerful tool into a robust, enterprise-grade platform. This track focuses on security, resilience, scalability, and integration with professional devops workflows.

## Scope
- **In**: Secure credential management, full implementation of resilience patterns (exponential backoff, session recovery), advanced plugin capabilities (custom navigators/providers), and CI/CD integration helpers.
- **Out**: SOC2 compliance, hardware security module (HSM) integration, or real-time multi-user collaboration.

## Success Criteria
- Credentials can be securely passed to scripts without being logged or hardcoded.
- Aria can automatically recover from common browser and network failures.
- Developers can extend Aria with custom browser drivers and AI backends.
- Aria can be easily integrated into a headless CI pipeline.
