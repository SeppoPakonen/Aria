### Aria Implementation Progress

### Last Completed Task
- **Track**: 05-site-specific-data-and-scraping
- **Phase**: 05-sync-and-maintenance
- **Task**: 04-full-verification-and-hardening
- **Final Alignment**: Successfully completed the full suite of scrapers and synchronization helpers. Aria can now:
  1. Deep-crawl and shallow-refresh multiple sites (Google Messages, WhatsApp, Discord, Threads, Calendar, YouTube Studio).
  2. Maintain persistent registries for chats and threads.
  3. Synthesize information across all sites to proactively suggest real-world goals (Synthesis Engine).
  4. Perform data maintenance (cleanup, archival).
  5. Handle non-persistent, undetected browser sessions with robust error recovery.

### Next Task to Implement
- **Project Complete**: Core Roadmap fulfilled. Aria is ready for operational deployment and user-driven expansion.
