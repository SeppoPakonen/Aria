## Gemini Added Memories
- The assembly configuration in Maestro now uses directory roots (as in U++ .var files) instead of package names. Include paths in builds are restricted to these roots and package-specific options.
- The assembly configuration system has been fully updated to support U++ .var files and .upp options section. The changes have been pushed to origin/main.
- Project progress is tracked in `docs/plan/cookie.txt`. This file indicates the last completed task and the next task to be executed. The main plan files (in `docs/plan/`) should not be edited unless the plan itself requires revision. The `cookie.txt` file is the source of truth for implementation progress.
