## Gemini Added Memories
- The assembly configuration in Maestro now uses directory roots (as in U++ .var files) instead of package names. Include paths in builds are restricted to these roots and package-specific options.
- The assembly configuration system has been fully updated to support U++ .var files and .upp options section. The changes have been pushed to origin/main.
- Project progress is tracked in `docs/plan/cookie.txt`. This file indicates the last completed task and the next task to be executed. The main plan files (in `docs/plan/`) should not be edited unless the plan itself requires revision. The `cookie.txt` file is the source of truth for implementation progress.
- Fixed cross-test interference in the test suite by removing global `sys.modules` patching in `tests/test_navigator_plugins.py` and `tests/test_artifact_export.py`.
- Verified 100% test pass rate (51 tests) for the Aria CLI project, confirming robustness of MVP and advanced features.
- Implemented robust binary detection for Chromium and Firefox on Linux in `src/navigator.py`.
- Added support for Firefox profiles in the `open` command via the `--profile` argument. Using `--profile` with Firefox uses the profile directory DIRECTLY (no copy), enabling persistence but requiring the profile to be unlocked.
- Added `aria page interact <prompt>` command to allow natural language interaction with page elements (e.g., "Click the login button").
- Updated `GeminiProvider` to support implicit/local authentication (e.g., gcloud auth) by making the `GEMINI_API_KEY` check optional.
- Updated `README.md` with Gentoo Linux installation instructions for `net-misc/geckodriver` and `www-apps/chromedriver-bin`.
- Migrated from deprecated `google-generativeai` to the new `google-genai` SDK. Updated `GeminiProvider` to use the `Client` object and switched the default model to `gemini-1.5-flash`.
